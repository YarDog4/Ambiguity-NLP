# Ambiguity-NLP:

This GitHub repository contains notebooks for our COSC 524 final project on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD). As a group, we implement and compare different tokenization approaches (character-level, subword, and word embeddings) to establish text-only baselines. We then calculate cosine similarity scores of captions containing homographs (e.g., bank, jam, bat) to measure ambiguity. Finally, we integrate image embeddings (via CLIP) to test how visual context shifts similarity scores and reduces linguistic ambiguity. The project explores how tokenization and embeddings interact with multimodal models, and quantifies the extent to which images improve disambiguation of ambiguous captions.

The above is subject to change.

Task 1: Tokenization & Embedding Pipeline (by: Danny & Shamik)

Task 2: Cosine Similarity Experiments with Homographs (we should all work on this together)

Task 3: Image-based Disambiguation with CLIP (or something more recent) - (we should all work on this together)

Task 4: Lexical + Visual Knowledge Integration (WordNet + Vision)? - (we should all work on this together)
